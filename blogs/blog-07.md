### login 

Recent classes discussed Json Web Tokens, or JWT, and their role in user sessions. PassportJS offers a number of strategies to complete authentication using JWT. Since I used Auth0 services for my milestone two submission, I will most likely use it for my final submission. I am also tempted to attempt my final submission using Ethereum and IPFS in place of a traditional login and server backend. I can also use them to give and recieve tokens related to the open source kitchen. Possibly focusing on using the ERC721 token, also know as an NFT, in the process. 

A year or so before I cam to NMIT, I coded out a couple logins and authentication services. The experience taught me a couple things: I do not enjoy coding out those parts nor do I wish to do it again. There are already established packages and libraries that accomplish those tasks much better than I can. I will never get an entry level job that will ask me to complete such a task by myself. I am confident enough with my web stack that I could accomplish such a task in a team environment using documentation and industry level libraries and packages.

As far as coding goes, I am more of a macro developer. I do not enjoy going deep into any code really, I prefer using code blocks to build a project with broad strokes. I fell in love with web development because of jQuery, the write less do more approach really appealed to me and made the entire world of web development much more accessible.

I did not grow up around computers, and most of my prior knowledge has been gathered during the two years prior to me arriving at NMIT.
