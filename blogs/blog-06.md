### milestone two

Just working on milestone two. Nothing new presented in class. Everyone is scrambling to complete this milestone. I have chosen the path of least resistance, which gave me a chance to practice using Vue, Mongo, Node, Express, and Auth0. 

There has been very little focus about Mongo and using mongoose as a client. I definitely struggle with using mongoose. My focus recently has been around using decentralized services when possible. [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) has been the most interesting thing I have stumbled upon lately, and I really believe the future of the internet will be a distributed web. IPFS in combination with a distributed network, such as Ethereum, can provide the same services and functionality as a traditional server database backend, in a much safer and transparent manner using cryptographic hashing and blockchain technology.
