### MEAN tuts && typescript

I struggled with the mean tutorial, because it wasnt helping me to understand much about angular. so i deviated tutorials and completed [the official angluar tut](https://angular.io/tutorial) instead. The official tutorial helped me better understand how angular was configured and why, it helped me better understand the way the components interact and useful scenarios when angular would be an ideal framework. I have mostly worked on smaller projects, and I dont believe angular is beneficial for such projects. It is better suited for large scale projects, or projects that will eventually scale in size.

I have limited experience with typescript, but find it very enjoyable and immediately realize the benefits of it. I often think of it as an exo skeleton for javascript that makes sure everything moves the right way and increases the integrity of the code. I plan on using it more, as it is quickly being adopted in the modern workforce.
