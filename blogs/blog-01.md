### MEAN stack tuts && express

This week was focused around finishing the MEAN tutorial, which i will do over the weekend, and looking at some aspects of express. I have played a bit with express and found it very confusing at first, especially understanding what `req` and `res` actually were, but now I am fairly confident when reading express code. And the stuff I don't know can easily be researched since I understand most of the context. Most of the material covered in class was easily understood.

I will also find some time to work on my brief and catch up on some other parts of assessment one.
