### more tutorials, angular and vue

We were given more tutorials and then discussed SCRUM. 

My hope was that this class was only related to Vue. A semester to learn two frameworks is unrealistic, and means that we probably won't get an in-depth knowledge of either. 

The main aspect of this class of Vue that attracts me is that it is open source and community driven in its development.

Angular is big, clunky, and streamlined in a very corporate structure. I see the value in the Angualar configuration, especially the inclusion of testing files within each component. This makes Angular powerful and ideal for large, extensive, and scaling projects.

We talk about SCRUM and agile in every class. It's a bit overkill and unnecessaryat at this point. Most of us will only really understand it when we actually participate in an office place stand-up.
