# Phillip Shields WEB701 Repo

This repo has two directories. One for blogs, and the other for the class assessment project.

I have enabled discussions on this repo, just click on the Discussions tab above. I created two sections for discussion, one for ideas and another specifically for questions that you would like answered.
