# Milestone 2 Evaluate

## Framework Purpose

Front-end frameworks are packages containing standardized code that makes the development of a UI much more effecient and slightly simplified at the same time. Modern web development has a wide variety of frameworks available that serve different purposes. The frameworks discussed in this report concern JavaScript frameworks used to create stable and effecient user-interfaces used on the website.   

### Vue

Vue is an open-source MVVM JavaScript framework. The MVVM pattern used in Vue make it popular for UI development, especially with single-page applications (SPAs). It is often referred to as "the progressive framework" because of the ease in which developers can remove and add features. Vues most unique feature is directives, which are used to manipulate the DOM via HTML attribute bindings.

### Angular

Angular is an open-source MVC TypeScript framework developed by Google in 2010. A major feature of Angular is its use of static typing. Static typing makes sure that errors are caught earlier in the development process by checking them at  compile time, as opposed to dynamic typing which can lead to errors during runtime. 

## Framework Features

### Vue

There are many features in Vue giving it a clear advantage in certain use-cases. The first and most noticeable feature is the file size of Vue. The whole framework is considered very lightweight at just around 20 kilobytes. This means smaller projects can be setup in very little time. Another useful feature is its native CLI. Vues small size combined with a well documented CLI let developers get started with just a simple CLI configuration wizard. This makes developing with Vue very friendly and accessible for developers of all levels. Vue also comes with some community maintained advanced features that help with state management and routing.

### Angular

Angular is feature rich framework that utlises the MVC architecture. The use of MVC architecture is wildly popular amongst developers, especially because of its ability to utilise two-way data binding between the model and view. Another major feature of Angular is that is cross-platform, you can use it to build a UI for pretty much any system. Angular has a very useful and well documented CLI. Many developers prefer the CLI has it helps alleviate some common frustrations with component creation, webpack, and other tedious tasks that allow developers to focus on the right kind of code. Angular has very notable and consistent contributions from Microsoft and Google, giving it strong credibility among developers.
