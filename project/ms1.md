> ### WEBSITE BRIEF
 
> #### CHARITY NAME : OPEN SOURCE KITCHENS



> ##### The members of the Open-Source Kitchens are interested in having a website of their own. The following is a brief description of the proposed website:


Open-Source Kitchens is a “community style” kitchen in the Nelson region that offer meals prepared by the local community to the local community. 

We need a website for the Nelson region for members of the charity to spread information and acquire support from the community. The website lets users register and make donations in the form of their time, money, or physical goods. The website will also provide important upcoming event information.

Members will be given tokens after successful donations, and a certain number of tokens will allow members to act in more important kitchen roles, to help design the weeks menu, or to act as an administrator.

We require the following features on the website:

- 1.Kitchen members and beneficiaries can register, log in and administer their own accounts.
- 2.Members use the website to register their donations and collect tokens
- 3.Interactive element(s) that engages the website user.
- 4.The system provides an interface for the members to accept and view their tokens.


> ### WEBSITE REQUIREMENTS

- #### WEBSITE GOALS
The purpose of this website is to act as a organizational hub for our open-source kitchen. Our short term goal is to quickly increase membership, while our long term goal is to create a sustainable volunteer based kitchen that will help ensure that no one in our community does not have access to a healthy meal. The main audience for the website is anyone that is committed to helping and feeding our community in a social and equitable environment. Our hope is that a few well intentioned members of the community will immediately find value in our mission, join, and then help us build outward and gain more membership.

- #### USER EXPERIENCE
The overall user experience should be extremely simple and almost automated for the user. This will ensure that users aren't prevented from helping
