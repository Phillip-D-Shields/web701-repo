# CHARITY NAME : OPEN SOURCE KITCHENS

## WEBSITE BRIEF

> ### The members of the Open-Source Kitchens are interested in having a website of their own. The following is a brief description of the proposed website:


Open-Source Kitchens is a “community style” kitchen in the Nelson region that offer meals prepared by the local community to the local community. 

We need a website for the Nelson region for members of the charity to spread information. 

> #### 03/02/21
The purpose of the new website is to help with the distribution of the service or product by members of our charity to customers. Like a “food bank”, the website lets members register and describe the service or products they are providing, the numberand frequency of the offerings.

The website lets members of the community (beneficiaries) access the service, by providing tokens that can be “spent” in the service. To achieve our goal, we would like to have an online token function on our website that let a beneficiary access a limited number of tokens, for example the system needs a mechanism that verifies that a member of the community is accessing the service and that the token belongs to a particular community member. The website needs some homepage text about general information of our products and services such as: types, characteristics, quality factor, usage and benefit.

We require the following features on the website:

- 1.Charity members and beneficiaries can register, log in and administer their own accounts.
- 2.Members use the website to register their products and services, and beneficiaries use the system to acquire tokens.
- 3.Interactive element(s) that engages the website user.
- 4.The system provides an interface that the members canuse toaccepta token in a transaction.
